##### ABANDONED

My first project with Java that was abandonded as I realised the idea of deploying was becoming increasingly unlikely! It is a simple JavaFX program to help build team rosters with annual employee targets. Was built for a purpose when I started the project but as time went on I realised that the problem was too big for me tackle, but I went went on to finish this part of the project for experience anyway.
